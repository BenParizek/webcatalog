## 7.0
A few months ago, we started building WebCatalog from scratch to provide a simpler, more unified experience. Since then, we’ve redesigned the app, rebuilt the core components and fixed many bugs. Here’s an overview of what you’ll see in 7.0.

#### Material Design
Inspired by Google’s beautiful design language, we completely changed WebCatalog’s appearance.

#### Molecule
To move the app development forward, we decided to rebuild the engine powering WebCatalog Apps. We named it Molecule.

With Molecule:

- WebCatalog Apps now run independently from WebCatalog. It means you can uninstall or move WebCatalog to external storage without affecting those apps. 
- Notifications now work properly.
- Many critical bugs are fixed.

We also added Dark Mode, Navigation Bar Toggle, etc. And we planned to add many more features in the upcoming updates.

#### Auto Update
WebCatalog 7+ will download and install new update in background!
